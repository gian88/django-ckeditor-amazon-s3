        Installation
        ------------
        
        Required
        ~~~~~~~~
        #. Install or add django-ckeditor to your python path.
        
        #. Add ``ckeditor`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
        
        #. Add a CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies an absolute filesystem path to your CKEditor media upload directory. Make sure you have write permissions for the path, i.e.::
        
            CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH = "/home/media/media.lawrence.com/uploads"
        
        #. Run the ``collectstatic`` management command: ``$ /manage.py collectstatic``. This'll copy static CKEditor require media resources into the directory given by the ``STATIC_ROOT`` setting. See `Django's documentation on managing static files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files>`_ for more info.
        
        #. Add CKEditor URL include to your project's ``urls.py`` file::
            
            (r'^ckeditor/', include('ckeditor.urls')),    
        
        Optional
        ~~~~~~~~
        #. Set the CKEDITOR_RESTRICT_BY_USER setting to ``True`` in the project's ``settings.py`` file (default ``False``). This restricts access to uploaded images to the uploading user (e.g. each user only sees and uploads their own images). Superusers can still see all images. **NOTE**: This restriction is only enforced within the CKEditor media browser. 
        
        #. Add a CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PREFIX setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies a URL prefix to media uploaded through CKEditor, i.e.::
        
               CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PREFIX = "http://media.lawrence.com/media/ckuploads/
               
           (If CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PREFIX is not provided, the media URL will fall back to MEDIA_URL with the difference of MEDIA_ROOT and the uploaded resource's full path and filename appended.)
        
        #. Add a CKEDITOR_CONFIGS setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This specifies sets of CKEditor settings that are passed to CKEditor (see CKEditor's `Setting Configurations <http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Setting_Configurations>`_), i.e.::
        
               CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {
                   'awesome_ckeditor': {
                       'toolbar': 'Basic',
                   },
               }
           
           The name of the settings can be referenced when instantiating a RichTextField::
        
               content = RichTextField(config_name='awesome_ckeditor')
        
           The name of the settings can be referenced when instantiating a CKEditorWidget::
        
               widget = CKEditorWidget(config_name='awesome_ckeditor')
           
           By specifying a set named ``default`` you'll be applying its settings to all RichTextField and CKEditorWidget objects for which ``config_name`` has not been explicitly defined ::
               
               CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {
                   'default': {
                       'toolbar': 'Full',
                       'height': 300,
                       'width': 300,
                   },
               }
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Field
        ~~~~~
        The quickest way to add rich text editing capabilities to your models is to use the included ``RichTextField`` model field type. A CKEditor widget is rendered as the form field but in all other regards the field behaves as the standard Django ``TextField``. For example::
        
            from django.db import models
            from ckeditor.fields import RichTextField
        
            class Post(models.Model):
                content = RichTextField()
        
        
        Widget
        ~~~~~~
        Alernatively you can use the included ``CKEditorWidget`` as the widget for a formfield. For example::
        
            from django import forms
            from django.contrib import admin
            from ckeditor.widgets import CKEditorWidget
        
            from post.models import Post
        
            class PostAdminForm(forms.ModelForm):
                content = forms.CharField(widget=CKEditorWidget())
                class Meta:
                    model = Post
        
            class PostAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
                form = PostAdminForm
            
            admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin)
        
        Managment Commands
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Included is a management command to create thumbnails for images already contained in ``CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH``. This is useful to create thumbnails when starting to use django-ckeditor with existing images. Issue the command as follows::
            
            $ ./manage.py generateckeditorthumbnails
        
        **NOTE**: If you're using custom views remember to include ckeditor.js in your form's media either through ``{{ form.media }}`` or through a ``<script>`` tag. Admin will do this for you automatically. See `Django's Form Media docs <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/media/>`_ for more info.
